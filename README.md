# AirBnB_clone

## Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.
This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

### the command interpreter:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object****

## Console Execution :

- **create:** `$ create <class>`

- **destroy:** `$ destroy <class> <id>`
